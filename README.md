# Fashion-MNIST_LogisticRegression_OnevsAll_NoLibrary

Fashion-MNIST dataset is a dataset of Zalandoâ€™s article images. This dataset is divided into train and test sets. The training set has 60,000 samples and testing set has 10,000 samples. Fashion-MNIST has the same 28x28 image size and structure of training and testing splits as MNIST dataset. The images are grey scale and are labeled from these 10 classes.

I write this code based on sigmoid function in logistic regression. I use all vs one technique to classify 10 classes in this dataset
